## Process Flow

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded and cleaned both datasets using Pandas  
- Renamed columns, handled nulls, and merged datasets  

### 2. Analysis and Aggregation
- Calculated maximum infection rate per country  
- Merged happiness and COVID datasets on country names  

### 3. Visualization
- Plotted infection trends, scatterplots, and correlation heatmaps  
- Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to reveal relationships
